# EaglercraftX Replit Archive Mod


Hi everyone!

First, please go buy Minecraft.

Ok, done? Now we can proceed...

This is a mod of a slimmed down EaglercraftX 1.8.8 archive to add singleplayer.
To make a new world just fork this and set playercount to 1: https://replit.com/@ayunami2000/eaglercraft?v=1
Yes it is a broken server. Mojang can fix it if eaglercraft ever becomes official.

I as a modder only made this so no-one has to mod eaglercraftX to get singleplayer. Just run [main.sh] and play.
Thanks to eaglercraft devs!
